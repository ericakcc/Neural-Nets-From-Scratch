# Neural Networks From Scratch

This project aims to implement various classic neural network architectures from scratch using PyTorch. The main purpose is to gain a deep understanding of how these models work internally and provide detailed implementation processes.

## Implemented Models

- [ ] ResNet
  - Deep Residual Network that solves the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks through skip connections
  - Implementation details: [ResNet/](./ResNet/)

- [ ] YOLOv3
  - Fast and accurate object detection network
  - Implementation details: [YOLOv3/](./YOLOv3/)

## Environment Setup

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
